- **Ad Attribution and Web Analytics**

UpStack Data empowers marketers to enhance revenue and reduce Customer Acquisition Costs (CPAs) through advanced server-side tracking pixels leveraging first-party data. Our platform is designed to improve Event Match Quality (EMQ), rectify iOS 14+ attribution challenges, and boost Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) within days.

## Key Features

- **Enterprise-Grade Identity Resolution**: Accurately track and activate returning visitors across devices over time, increasing audience size and segments by over 50%. 

- **Enhanced Event Match Quality**: Utilize PersistentID to extend cookie lifetimes, restore lost cookies, and amplify EMQ, ensuring your campaigns receive the highest post-click intent signals for Meta's machine learning feedback loop. 

- **iOS 14+ Attribution Fixes**: Address signal loss due to iOS 14+ updates with our first-party tracker, replacing outdated Meta data-sharing methods and pixels. 

- **Increased Abandonment Revenue**: Enhance Klaviyo ROI by capturing 45% more abandonment flows, ensuring your email service provider doesn't "forget" visitors who have already opted in.
